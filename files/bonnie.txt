 Bonnie Swanson is Joe's calm and soft-spoken wife, and mother of Kevin and Susie Swanson. She is pregnant from her first appearance in "A Hero Sits Next Door" in season one until "Ocean's Three and a Half" in season seven, when she gives birth to a daughter named Susie. Her prolonged pregnancy is pointed out by Peter in the season four episode "Blind Ambition." Joe temporarily leaves her in "Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air", when he regains the ability to walk. He returns to her when she tries shooting him to paralyze him. After missing several times, he shoots himself. Bonnie is arrested in "The Hand That Rocks The Wheelchair" after Meg plants a gun in her purse due to Meg's infatuation with Joe, which she acquires when Bonnie asks her to look after Joe while she is out of town. In "Foreign Affairs", Bonnie goes to Paris with Lois in the hopes of having an affair after feeling neglected by Joe. She nearly leaves Joe for a French man, also in a wheelchair, named Fran√ßois. After intervention from Lois, Joe comes to Paris and apologizes for neglecting her before proving his love by walking (although it is actually Quagmire walking, tied to Joe's back). Bonnie reunites with Joe and they return to Quahog. In the season ten episode "Internal Affairs," it is shown that Bonnie was once a stripper at The Fuzzy Clam where she first met Joe.
