Brian Griffin, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, is the Griffin family's pet dog. Brian has lived with the Griffin family since Peter picked him up as a stray. Peter is his best friend, despite Brian's superior intelligence. Brian is often the voice of reason for the family, frequently reminding Peter how stupid or corrupt his ideas are. He also has a very close friendship with Stewie, and the two of them have been at the center of some of the most critically acclaimed episodes during the series, most notably the Road to... episodes.

Seth MacFarlane has once described Brian as "a dog who has a wit as dry as the martinis he drinks."[38] MacFarlane also revealed that Brian is his favorite character from the series, as he feels most comfortable when playing that role.[39]

Brian was (temporarily) killed off, after he was hit by a car in the season 12 episode "Life of Brian". Brian however, returned two episodes later, in "Christmas Guy", after Stewie went back in time to save him.[40]
