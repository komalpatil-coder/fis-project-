Christopher Cross “Chris” Griffin, voiced by Seth Green. Chris is the teenage son of the family, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, a younger version of his father. Though Chris is not the brightest one in the family, he is particularly coherent and makes good points when talking about movies. Chris deals with the problems that most pubescent boys face: acne, girls, and school. He is 15 years old and, like Meg, is enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. Chris has been known to feel self-conscious about himself, especially his weight. In fact, on the Volume 1 DVD Boxset, it stated that Chris "would not hurt a fly, unless it landed on his hot dog." He was referred to as an "Elephant Child" when he was born. Chris is also willing to do something as drastic as to convert to Judaism order to do better in school, specifically math. He once believed his low grades in mathematics were caused by himself when he tickled his brain by sticking an army man's rifle into his nose and accidentally puncturing a lobe.
