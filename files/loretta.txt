Loretta Brown is Cleveland's late ex-wife, and the mother of Cleveland, Jr. She had a liking for cricket and the television program Friends. Early in the show, Loretta had a minimal quantity of lines, the bulk of which were "Mm-hmm!" She treats Cleveland harshly, and eventually cheats on him with Glenn Quagmire, leading the Browns to divorce. In the episode "Love, Blactually", it is revealed that Loretta has regretted her actions and wants Cleveland back, but he refuses her advances. Cleveland informs her he needs to move on, and advises her to do the same. She takes Cleveland's house in the divorce and puts it up for sale, yet is still apparently living there some months later. In The Cleveland Show episode "Gone with the Wind," Loretta dies in an accident when Peter drops an Apatosaurus skeleton (which Brian had dug up from the Griffin Family's yard) on her house and she goes through the same bathtub gag that Cleveland went through which she doesn't survive. Quagmire ended up driving her body down to Stoolbend for her funeral. It is revealed in this episode that she had also cheated on Cleveland with Mayor Adam West, Ollie Williams, Frank Sinatra, Jr., and the Greased Up Deaf Guy.
