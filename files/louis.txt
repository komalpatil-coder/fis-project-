Lois Griffin (n√©e Pewterschmidt), voiced by Alex Borstein. Lois is the mother of the Griffin family. Lois's morals are often questionable. She went through a brief period of kleptomania in the episode "Breaking Out Is Hard to Do", for which she went to prison. She also showed a gambling addiction when the family went to an Indian casino in "The Son Also Draws" during the first season. Various episodes have hinted that Lois is a drug user, but this is shown most clearly in "Deep Throats". She revealed that she smoked marijuana when she was pregnant with Stewie, a claim backed-up by series creator Seth MacFarlane on a DVD commentary. Also, when asked by Peter where she got a tattoo on her lower back, she replied, 'Oh, I do not know Peter, meth is a hell of a drug' (Prick Up Your Ears). She also hints that she engaged in similar activities when a younger Meg was around. When Meg is thought to have become pregnant, Lois tells her to "smoke and drink a lot" (when Meg does not want to have an abortion, which Lois hinted at beforehand) She also mentions, "but do not start then chicken out half way or you end up with Chris," which implies she smoked and consumed alcohol while pregnant with Chris.
