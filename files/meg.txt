Megan “Meg” Griffin, voiced by Mila Kunis. Meg is a disturbed and self-conscious teenage girl who is enrolled at James Woods Regional High School. Her self-consciousness causes her to desperately try to be part of the cool crowd, but this only results in her getting coldly rebuffed by Connie D'Amico,[34] the bullying head cheerleader of her school. She is also usually at the bottom of the family's pecking order and the butt of Peter's jokes due to her homeliness, tendency toward social awkwardness and lack of popularity. However, another student named Neil Goldman is attracted to her.[35] She has been so self-conscious about herself that she engaged in dangerous sexual behavior just for attention.
