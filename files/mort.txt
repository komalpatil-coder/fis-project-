Mort Goldman is a Jewish pharmacist with Polish ancestry, and one of Peter's friends. He runs Goldman's Pharmacy and was married to Muriel Goldman with whom he has one son Neil. Mort's defining characteristics are stereotypically Jewish such as his whiny neuroticism, his chronic hypochondria, his wimpy attitude and his general gawkiness. Mort frequently discusses his various disgusting maladies and childhood bullying in otherwise polite conversation. He takes on the characteristics of Sol Rosenberg, a character from The Jerky Boys created by Johnny Brennan in the late 1980s. Although he first appeared one season after his son Neil, Mort has since become a major supporting character. Mort also bowled a perfect game in the episode "Blind Ambition". Mort plays a jawa in the "Blue Harvest" episode, and Lando Calrissian in the "Something, Something, Something, Dark Side" and "It's a Trap!" episodes.
