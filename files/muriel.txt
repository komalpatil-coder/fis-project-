 Muriel is Mort's wife, whose physical appearance is very close to her husband's. She met Mort via a video dating service, presumably during their youth, as they had their first kiss at age of fourteen while both of them were suffering from a head cold. Later in her life, one of her main recreations was watching old films along with the album Hotel California to find if any of them synchronize. She was murdered in the Season 9 premiere "And Then There Were Fewer" by being stabbed in the back by Diane Simmons.
