Neil Goldman is Mort's stereotypical nerdy son, who has an unrequited crush on Meg Griffin. He is the editor of the school newspaper, is part of the A/V Club, and works at his father's pharmacy where he is employee of the month, according to Family Guy Online.[4] He is more confident than his father, so much so that he does not seem to realize that Meg has nothing but contempt for him. At one point in the series, both Neil and Meg become interns at Channel 5, and they share a kiss. Neil speaks with a lisp when he wears his retainer, but when he removes it, he speaks with a deep, smooth bass (cf. the apocryphal story that Demosthenes improved his elocutionary skills by holding stones in his mouth during everyday speech). Seth MacFarlane does his voice (nearly identical to the voice of Stan Smith from MacFarlane's American Dad!) until Neil puts his retainer back in. He has made few appearances in the series in recent years, being absent entirely in the fifth and eighth seasons, and only making silent cameo appearances during the ninth and eleventh seasons. "Peter's Daughter," "Stew-Roids," "You Can't Do That on Television, Peter," "Friends Without Benefits," "A Fistful of Meg," and "Secondhand Spoke" are to date the only episodes since the fourth season where he has spoken. His reaction to his mother's murder is still unknown. In "You Can't Do That on Television, Peter", Neil says that he cannot dissect the fetal pig in biology class for religious reasons where his teacher remarks that it's no thrill for a pig to touch a Jew either.
