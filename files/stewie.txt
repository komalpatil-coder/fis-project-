Stewart Gilligan “Stewie” Griffin, voiced by Seth MacFarlane. Stewie is the youngest Griffin member. A sociopathic one year old, hell-bent on killing his mother and taking over the world, Stewie serves the anti-hero of the show. Though he was originally an evil child-genius, in more recent episodes he is a more flamboyant (possibly homosexual) character. Despite always having a rivalry with the family dog, Brian, he and Brian share a very close friendship, and they admitted that they loved each other, in the episode "Brian & Stewie". Stewie is considered to be the show's breakout character.[36] Wizard magazine rated him the 95th greatest villain of all time.[37]
